* Week 1
>Took lead of the group and asked everyone to talk about their experiences and skills. We then discussed what project we would do and the technologies we would potentially use. After this, we created a server for all of us to talk in. I also setted up the Jira as the Scrum Master.

* Week 2
>Selected the project and finalised scrum roles for everyone. I then delegated the tasks to everyone for the proposal that was due in about a week.

* Week 3
>Revised the user stories and put it in Jira. Distributed the user stories to each sprint and wrote pretty much everything user story / sprint related in the proposal. Also, worked on the external actors section.

* Week 5
