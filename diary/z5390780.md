* Week 1
>Formed groups, exchanged contacts details, discussed potential projects and what technologies we would be most comfortable with

* Week 2
>Finalised which project we will select as well as which technologies we will use. Researched setup for MERN stack as to how to put everything together (connect backend to frontend)

* Week 3
>After research in week 2 on technology stack, used the research in technology stack part of proposal. After setting up the git repo, and setting up the project to be all connected (frontend connected to backend and working with MongoDB), wrote implementation for login/logout functionality. 

* Week 4
>Implemented backend routes and basic frontend implementation for login, logout, register, update user profile. Including setting up database, userModel for general users. Implemented HTTP only cookies as a way to authenticate users with JWT. Implemented private routes, so that un-authenicated users cannot access routes they shouldn't have access to. Setup basic testing with Postman.

* Week 5
> Changed HTTP only cookie approach as cookieParser() from Express was causing issues for a member of the team. Switched to storing JWT token in localStorage and adjusted existing functionality to accomodate this change. Adjusted some components to use MUI as team agreeed to use MUI components (React-bootstrap was only listed as CSS framework). Researched methods on how to effectively test the backend and frontend using Jest.
